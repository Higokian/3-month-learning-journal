### Wednesday, 2/4/2026 - Day 1 of 90

**Time Spent:** ~3 hours

#### 🎯 Today's Focus:

- [x] Set up dev environment
- [x] Review let/const, Arrow Functions, Template Strings
- [x] Light reading on Destructuring

#### 📚 What I Learned:

- Arrow function syntax - [Let arrow = num => console.log(`${num}) ]
- Arrow functions take away the need to bind 'this' to '\_this' when working with an object outside of a function's scope

#### 💻 What I Built/Coded:

- I only spent some time completed exercises to help solidify the focus topics for today

#### 💡 Aha Moments:

- Arrow functions take away the need to bind 'this' to '\_this' when working with an object outside of a function's scope. I never understood the whole "\_this = this" trick until now! It's definitely a very convoluted way to reference an object that's outside of a function's scope.

#### 🚧 Challenges/Blockers:

- **Challenge:**
- **How I solved it (or plan to):**
- I was struggling to understand why logging a template literal containing html elements was only logging array items within it. I had to has Claude for help on this one. Turns part of the issue was trying to assign the log to a variable, rather than logging the variable itself. I also learned that console.log can hide html elements, which is most likely why the html elements were not appearing in my console.log.

#### ✅ Wins of the Day:

- Overcame a logging issue

#### 📝 Notes for Tomorrow:

- [ ] Since I started a day early, spend some time going through CodeWars challenges

#### 💭 Reflection:

Overall, I'm feeling pretty good about all of the topics I went over today. Being that I was already familiar with all of them, it all clicked pretty quickly. Despite that though, I still learned some new things! I'm excited to continue on and get into things unfamiliar.
