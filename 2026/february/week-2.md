### [Thursday], [2/12/2026] - Day [8] of 90

**Time Spent:** [~ 3 hours]

#### 🎯 Today's Focus:

- [x] [Learn DOM selection methods]
- [x] [Practice querySelector and querySelectorAll]
- [x] [Understand DOM tree navigation]
- [x] [Start interactive quiz app HTML/CSS]

#### 📚 What I Learned:

- How to manipulate and traverse the DOM
- That the DOM is essentially a tree of nodes

#### 💻 What I Built/Coded:

- Completed some DOM exercises
- Set up quiz app (HTML/CSS and created data in JS);

#### 💡 Aha Moments:

- For the longest time, I've never understood just how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. A lot of courses out there don't really cover the DOM and focus solely on JavaScript concepts.

#### 🔗 Resources Used:

- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/document)
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

#### ✅ Wins of the Day:

- Finally understanding how to manipulate the DOM
-

#### 📝 Notes for Tomorrow:

- [ ] Creating that logic for the quiz app!

#### 💭 Reflection:

I'm feeling pretty good about manipulating the DOM and using selectors. I definitely still need more practice with it, but I think I have a strong start.

### [Friday], [2/13/2026] - Day [9] of 90

**Time Spent:** [~2 hours]

#### 🎯 Today's Focus:

- [ ] [Master addEventListener]
- [ ] [Understand event object]
- [ ] [Build quiz logic]
- [ ] [Handle user interactions]

#### 📚 What I Learned:

- A few different event's, such as 'click, 'dblclick', 'input' and 'change'
-
-

#### 💻 What I Built/Coded:

- I finished about half of the Quiz app
-

#### 💡 Aha Moments:

- Issue getting exercise 2 to work.... turns out I forgot to include 'target' in `event.target.value;`
- 


#### 🚧 Challenges/Blockers:

- **Challenge:**
- Biggest challenge right now isn't code related. Starting on time has proved difficult due to being tired after work, sometimes having a couple errands to do in between work and learning, while also trying to fit in a nap so I feel a little refreshed. 
- **How I solved it (or plan to):**
- Not sure on this one yet. I might need to adjust my schedule or extend the number of days to complete everything. I'm going to try to keep up the rest of week 2 before making any decisions.

#### 🔗 Resources Used:

- [dblclick event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/dblclick_event)

#### ✅ Wins of the Day:

- Getting the quiz to the point of displaying the question/answers and a functional progress bar
-

#### 📝 Notes for Tomorrow:

- [ ] Gotta focus on getting caught up
- [ ] Finish quiz app

#### 💭 Reflection:

My energy level is a bit low. Getting up at 1:30am to get to work by 3:00am and then getting home around noon is rough. I'm mostly concerned about being able to keep up with my schedule and ensuring I'm retaining what I learn. I fell asleep sitting at my desk today...
