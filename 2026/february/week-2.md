### [Thursday], [2/12/2026] - Day [8] of 90

**Time Spent:** [~ 3 hours]

#### 🎯 Today's Focus:

- [x] [Learn DOM selection methods]
- [x] [Practice querySelector and querySelectorAll]
- [x] [Understand DOM tree navigation]
- [x] [Start interactive quiz app HTML/CSS]

#### 📚 What I Learned:

- How to manipulate and traverse the DOM
- That the DOM is essentially a tree of nodes

#### 💻 What I Built/Coded:

- Completed some DOM exercises
- Set up quiz app (HTML/CSS and created data in JS);

#### 💡 Aha Moments:

- For the longest time, I've never understood just how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. A lot of courses out there don't really cover the DOM and focus solely on JavaScript concepts.

#### 🔗 Resources Used:

- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/document)
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

#### ✅ Wins of the Day:

- Finally understanding how to manipulate the DOM
-

#### 📝 Notes for Tomorrow:

- [ ] Creating that logic for the quiz app!

#### 💭 Reflection:

I'm feeling pretty good about manipulating the DOM and using selectors. I definitely still need more practice with it, but I think I have a strong start.
