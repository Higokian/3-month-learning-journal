## Accountability & Tracking

### Daily Log Template:

```
Date: _______
Time spent: _______
What I learned: _______
What I built: _______
Blockers: _______
Tomorrow's focus: _______
```

### Weekly Review Questions:

1. Did I meet my weekly goal?
2. What was my biggest win this week?
3. What challenged me most?
4. What should I adjust for next week?
5. Am I on track for my 3-month goal?

---

## Motivation Tips

- **Join communities:** freeCodeCamp Discord, Reddit r/learnprogramming
- **Find an accountability partner:** Post daily progress
- **Celebrate small wins:** Every bug fixed is progress
- **Don't compare:** Focus on YOUR journey
- **Take breaks:** Burnout helps no one
- **Ask for help:** When stuck >30 mins, ask online

## Emergency "Falling Behind" Recovery Plan

If you miss 2+ days or fall behind schedule:

1. **Don't panic** - it happens to everyone
2. **Assess realistically** - what can you catch up on?
3. **Prioritize** - focus on building projects over tutorials
4. **Adjust timeline** - add 1-2 weeks if needed
5. **Get back on track** - start with just 2 hours tomorrow

**Remember:** Consistency beats intensity. Better to code 4 hours daily than 12 hours twice a week.
